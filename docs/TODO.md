FEATURE: Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token
STARTED: 06-12
ENDED: 
BRANCH: csrf-token
WHO: Tomo
DESCRIPTION:
WHAT I LEARNT:
1. Cross Site Request Forgery
Let say the official site is A. The user is lured in to a malicious site B.
Site B makes a request to the server via A which the browser appends the cookie.

2. CSRF token 
An interface of a browser that does not permit any discovery or access from other sites. 

3. any modifying API calls i.e. DELETE, POST requiures double verfication,
cookie and CSRF token

4. Note that server does need to create and store sessional CSRF tokens
